# 📌 MODULE 1: SCM, VCS & Git Fundamentals

### 1.1 Source Code Management (SCM)
- What is SCM and why it is required: To track changes, manage code and create collaborative environment. 
- Role of SCM in DevOps and Agile: Agile tells what to build and how often. DevOps tells how to build, test, and deliver it fast. SCM connects both.
- Centralized vs Distributed SCM:

-- Centralized SCM: Single central repository, Requires network connection to commit, Limited offline work | Example: SVN
-- Distributed SCM: Every developer has a full repository copy, Commits work offline, Faster, safer, and more flexible | Example: Git, Murcurial, Bazaar

Common users of Centralized SCM: 
Legacy enterprises(banks, government departments, old IT service companies)
Mainframe / monolithic application teams
Highly controlled environments where strict access control is more important than speed

In short:
Centralized = one source
Distributed = many synchronized sources


### 1.2 Version Control System (VCS)
- What is a VCS
- File system vs Version Control System
- Types of VCS (Local, Centralized, Distributed)

### 1.3 Git Basics
- What is Git (full form and history)
- Why Git is used in DevOps
- Git architecture:
  - Working Directory
  - Staging Area
  - Local Repository
  - Remote Repository

### 1.4 Git Platforms
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- AWS CodeCommit
- Azure Repos
