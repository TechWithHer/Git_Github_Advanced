1. Git never tracks empty Directory!
2. Simple analogy: VCS = Engine and SCM = Full vehicle (engine + controls + safety + process)
3. VCS tracks code changes; SCM manages how code is developed, reviewed, and released.
4. Git = tool (VCS)
5. GitHub = platform (SCM)
6. SCM = discipline/process
7. VCS = version tracking system
